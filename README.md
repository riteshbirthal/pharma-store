This is an initial scaffold. I added placeholder SVG images in `public/images/owner.svg` and `public/images/shop.svg`.

Tip: replace those SVGs with real photos by placing them in `public/images/` with the same names.

Next steps: add product data store, routing, or a contact form — tell me which you prefer.
