# Shree Shyam Medicos — Pharma Store (React)

Simple Vite + React app for Shree Shyam Medicos.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Start dev server

   npm start

3. Build for production

   npm run build

4. Deploy to GitHub pages

   npm run deploy

Notes: This project uses Create React App. The build output goes to `build` and the `deploy` script publishes that folder to GitHub Pages (configured with the `homepage` field in `package.json`).

This is an initial scaffold. I added placeholder SVG images in `public/images/owner.svg` and `public/images/shop.svg`.

Tip: replace those SVGs with real photos by placing them in `public/images/` with the same names.

Next steps: add product data store, routing, or a contact form — tell me which you prefer.
